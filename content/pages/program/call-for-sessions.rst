Formats
-------

**Presentations** focus on a practitionerâ€™s ideas and experience
with anything relevant to Boost and Boost users.

**Panels** feature three or four people presenting their ideas and
experiences relating to Boost relevant, controversial, emerging, or
unresolved issues. Panels may be conducted in several ways, such as
comparative, analytic, or historic.

**Tutorials** are formally prepared sessions at which instructors
teach conference participants specific Boost relevant skills.

**Workshops** provide an active arena for advancements in Boost
relevant topics. Workshops provide the opportunity for experienced
practitioners to develop new ideas about a topic of common interest
and experience.

Other formats may also be of interest. Don't hold back a proposal
just because it doesn't fit into a pigeonhole.

Topics
------

Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to, the
following:

* General tutorial sessions introducing one or more Boost libraries

* In-depth sessions on using specific libraries

* Case studies on using Boost

* Experts panels

* Advanced sessions on implementation techniques used within Boost libraries

* TR1 (and TR2)

* Development workshops to extend or enhance existing Boost libraries

* Workshops on design process

* Infrastructure workshops

  - Build tools
  - Website
  - Testing

* C++0x and how it will change life for users and library writers

* Concepts and Generic Programming

* Other topics likely to be of great interest to Boost users and developers

Interactive and collaborative sessions are encouraged, as this is
the nature of both the online Boost community and the style of
learning and participation that has proven most successful at such
events. Sessions can be tutorial based, with an emphasis on
interaction and participant involvement, or workshop based, whether
hands-on programming or paper-based, discussion-driven
collaborative work.
