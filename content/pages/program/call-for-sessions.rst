Call for Sessions
=================

:order: 10


We invite you to submit session proposals to the 4th Annual Boost 
Conference: BoostCon 2010 (Aspen CO, USA, May 10-14, 2010).

Session topics
--------------

Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to, the
following:

* General tutorial sessions introducing one or more Boost 
  libraries
* In-depth sessions on using specific Boost libraries
* Case studies on using Boost
* Experts panels
* Advanced sessions on implementation techniques used within 
  Boost libraries
* C++0x and how it will change life for users and library writers
* Development workshops to extend or enhance existing Boost 
  libraries
* Workshops on design process
* Infrastructure workshops such as Build tools, Website, Testing
* Concepts and Generic Programming
* Hardware and infrastructure presentations focused on how 
  libraries can make better use of the technology
* Other topics likely to be of great interest to Boost users and 
  developers

Interactive and collaborative sessions are encouraged, as this is 
the nature of both the on-line Boost community and the style of 
learning and participation that has proven most successful at 
such events. Sessions can be tutorial based, with an emphasis on 
interaction and participant involvement, or workshop based, 
whether hands-on programming or paper-based, discussion-driven 
collaborative work.

Session formats
---------------

**Presentations** focus on a practitionerâ€™s ideas and experience
with anything relevant to Boost and Boost users.

**Panels** feature three or four people presenting their ideas and
experiences relating to Boost's relevant, controversial, emerging,
or unresolved issues. Panels may be conducted in several ways, such
as comparative, analytic, or historic.

**Tutorials** are formally prepared sessions at which instructors
teach conference participants specific Boost-relevant skills.

**Workshops** provide an active arena for advancements in
Boost-relevant topics. Workshops provide the opportunity for experienced
practitioners to develop new ideas about a topic of common interest
and experience.

**Author's Corner Presentations** were introduced at BoostCon 2008,
and were a great success.  They are short (30 minute) sessions,
focusing on tips on usage and design. In addition, we're looking to
uncover the hidden design gems in Boost libraries.

**Tool Vendor Presentations** We actively encourage tool vendors and
ISP's to submit proposals for a special Tool Vendors Session Track
aimed at products related to Boost and C++ (compilers, libraries,
tools, etc.).

Other formats may also be of interest. Don't hold back a proposal
just because it doesn't fit into a pigeonhole.

Submitting a proposal
---------------------

Standard Sessions are 90 minutes. You may submit a proposal for
fractions or multiples of 90-minutes. Fractional proposals will be
grouped into 90 minute sessions covering related topics. Longer
sessions, such as tutorials and classes, will be assigned 90
minute, three hour (i.e. half day), or six hour (i.e. full day)
time slots. 

Please include:

* The working title
* Type of session: presentation, panel, tutorial, workshop, authors corner, 
  vendor track, other
* A paragraph or two describing the topic covered, suitable for the 
  conference web site
* Proposed length: 10-20 minute short talks, 45 minutes, 90 minutes, 
  half day (3 hours), full day (6 hours)
* Alternate lengths, if you are willing to make adjustments: 10-20 minute 
  short-talks, 45 minutes, 90 minutes, half day (3 hours), full day (6 hours)
* Audience: users, developers, both
* Level: basic, intermediate, advanced

Financial Details
-----------------

Like Boost itself, BoostCon is strictly non-profit. Conference
organizers are not paid for their time. Any surplus money will be
rolled over into the succeeding year BoostCon budget. 

BoostCon provides free admission for all 90 minute and longer
session presenters. This year we also hope to have enough revenue
to pay presenters of longer sessions a small honorarium.
