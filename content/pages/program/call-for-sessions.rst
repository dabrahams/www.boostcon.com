Call for Sessions
=================

:order: 10

.. contents:: Index

Timeline
--------

**Proposals due** As soon as possible. Proposals will be accepted
on a first-come-first-served basis. 

**Proposals acceptances sent** As soon as accepted.

**Session materials due** April 15, 2008. The session material go
on the BoostCon CD handed out to attendees. 

Session formats
---------------

**Presentations** focus on a practitioner’s ideas and experience
with anything relevant to Boost and Boost users.

**Panels** feature three or four people presenting their ideas and
experiences relating to Boost's relevant, controversial, emerging,
or unresolved issues. Panels may be conducted in several ways, such
as comparative, analytic, or historic.

**Tutorials** are formally prepared sessions at which instructors
teach conference participants specific Boost-relevant skills.

**Workshops** provide an active arena for advancements in
Boost-relevant topics. Workshops provide the opportunity for experienced
practitioners to develop new ideas about a topic of common interest
and experience.

**Author's Corner Presentations** focus on tips on usage and
design.  In addition, we're looking to uncover the hidden design
gems hidden in boost libraries -- see below for more.

Other formats may also be of interest. Don't hold back a proposal
just because it doesn't fit into a pigeonhole.

Session topics
--------------

Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to, the
following:

* General tutorial sessions introducing one or more Boost libraries

* In-depth sessions on using specific libraries

* Case studies on using Boost

* Experts panels

* Advanced sessions on implementation techniques used within Boost libraries

* TR1 (and TR2)

* Development workshops to extend or enhance existing Boost libraries

* Workshops on design process

* Infrastructure workshops

  - Build tools
  - Website
  - Testing

* C++0x and how it will change life for users and library writers

* Concepts and Generic Programming

* Other topics likely to be of great interest to Boost users and developers

Interactive and collaborative sessions are encouraged, as this is
the nature of both the on-line Boost community and the style of
learning and participation that has proven most successful at such
events. Sessions can be tutorial based, with an emphasis on
interaction and participant involvement, or workshop based, whether
hands-on programming or paper-based, discussion-driven
collaborative work.

Author's corner presentations
-----------------------------

Based on user feedback from last year, we'd like to encourage Boost library authors to do short sessions (typically 30 minutes) providing an overview of their libraries, tips on usage and design.  In particular, we're looking to uncover the hidden design gems that underlie so many boost libraries.  Standard outline for a presentation is as follows -- feel free to deviate as needed.

* Library Purpose / Motivations
* Library Genesis & History

  * why you developed it
  * when it was accepted
  * how it has evolved
  
* Library Concepts
* Library Usage Overviews and Tips
* Library Design Decisions / Design Gems
* Question / Answer
 
Submitting a proposal
---------------------

Standard Sessions are 90 minutes. You may submit a proposal for
fractions or multiples of 90-minutes. Fractional proposals will be
grouped into 90 minute sessions covering related topics. Longer
sessions, such as tutorials and classes, will be assigned 90
minute, three hour (i.e. half day), or six hour (i.e. full day)
time slots. 

Please include:

* The working title.
* Type of session:
  presentation/panel/tutorial/workshop/lightning-talk/other
* A paragraph or two describing the topic covered, suitable for the
  conference web site
* Proposed length: 10-20 minute lightning-talks, 45 minutes, 90
  minutes, half-day, full day
* Alternate lengths, if you are willing to made adjustments: 10-20
  minute lightning-talks, 45 minutes, 90 minutes, half-day, full
  day
* Audience: users/developers/both
* Level: basic/intermediate/advanced
* A biography, suitable for the conference web site
* Your contact information (will not be made public)

Financial Details
-----------------

Like Boost itself, BoostCon is strictly non-profit. Conference
organizers are not paid for their time. Any surplus money will be
rolled over into the succeeding year BoostCon budget. 

BoostCon provides free admission for all 90 minute and longer
session presenters. This year we also hope to have enough revenue
to pay presenters of longer sessions a small honorarium.
