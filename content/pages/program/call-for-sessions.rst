Call for Sessions
=================

:order: 10

Timeline
--------

**Proposals due** January 20th, 2009. Proposals will be considered
on a first-come-first-served basis. 

**Proposals acceptances sent, tentative program available** February 10th, 2009.

**Final program available** March 1st, 2009.

**Session materials due** April 1st, 2009. 

Session formats
---------------

**Presentations** focus on a practitionerâ€™s ideas and experience
with anything relevant to Boost and Boost users.

**Panels** feature three or four people presenting their ideas and
experiences relating to Boost's relevant, controversial, emerging,
or unresolved issues. Panels may be conducted in several ways, such
as comparative, analytic, or historic.

**Tutorials** are formally prepared sessions at which instructors
teach conference participants specific Boost-relevant skills.

**Workshops** provide an active arena for advancements in
Boost-relevant topics. Workshops provide the opportunity for experienced
practitioners to develop new ideas about a topic of common interest
and experience.

**Author's Corner Presentations** focus on tips on usage and
design.  In addition, we're looking to uncover the hidden design
gems hidden in boost libraries -- see below for more.

**Tools Vendor Presentations** We actively encourage tool vendors and
ISP's to submit proposals for a special Tool Vendors Session Track
aimed at products related to Boost and C++ (compilers, libraries,
tools, etc.).

Other formats may also be of interest. Don't hold back a proposal
just because it doesn't fit into a pigeonhole.

Session topics
--------------

Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to, the
following:

* General tutorial sessions introducing one or more Boost libraries
* In-depth sessions on using specific libraries
* Case studies on using Boost
* Experts panels
* Advanced sessions on implementation techniques used within Boost libraries
* C++0x and how it will change life for users and library writers
* TR1 and TR2
* Development workshops to extend or enhance existing Boost libraries
* Workshops on design process
* Infrastructure workshops such as Build tools, Website, Testing
* Concepts and Generic Programming
* Hardware and infrastructure presentations focused on how libraries
  can make better use of the technology
* Other topics likely to be of great interest to Boost users and
  Developers.

Interactive and collaborative sessions are encouraged, as this is
the nature of both the on-line Boost community and the style of
learning and participation that has proven most successful at such
events. Sessions can be tutorial based, with an emphasis on
interaction and participant involvement, or workshop based, whether
hands-on programming or paper-based, discussion-driven
collaborative work.

Author's corner presentations
-----------------------------

These were introduced at BoostCon 2008, and were a great success.  An
authors corner takes 30 minutes and provides an overview of a library,
tips on usage and design.  In particular, we're looking to uncover the
hidden design gems that underlie so many boost libraries.  Standard
outline for a presentation is as follows -- feel free to deviate as
needed.

* Library Purpose / Motivations
* Library Genesis & History

  * why you developed it
  * when it was accepted
  * how it has evolved
  
* Library Concepts
* Library Usage Overviews and Tips
* Library Design Decisions / Design Gems
* Question / Answer
 
Submitting a proposal
---------------------

Standard Sessions are 90 minutes. You may submit a proposal for
fractions or multiples of 90-minutes. Fractional proposals will be
grouped into 90 minute sessions covering related topics. Longer
sessions, such as tutorials and classes, will be assigned 90
minute, three hour (i.e. half day), or six hour (i.e. full day)
time slots. 

Please include:

* The working title.
* Type of session: presentation, panel, tutorial, workshop, authors corner, 
  vendor track, other
* A paragraph or two describing the topic covered, suitable for the 
  conference web site
* Proposed length: 10-20 minute short talks, 45 minutes, 90 minutes, 
  half-day, full day
* Alternate lengths, if you are willing to make adjustments: 10-20 minute 
  lightning-talks, 45 minutes, 90 minutes, half-day, full day
* Audience: users, developers, both
* Level: basic, intermediate, advanced
* A biography, suitable for the conference web site
* Your contact information (will not be made public)

Submission details
------------------
Submissions are accepted through the EasyChair conference management 
system: http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=boostcon09. If you have 
not already registered at EasyChair, you will need to do so in order to 
submit your proposal.

All submissions will go through a peer review process.

Authors are invited to submit PDF versions of full papers of up to 10
pages in ACM conference proceedings format (see
http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates). The full
papers are not required unless you want them published in the
proceedings.

All accepted papers will be made available in the Association for Computing 
Machinery (ACM) Digital Library (approval pending). Best papers, after 
further reviews, will be considered to be book chapters or journal articles 
in a renowned journal. 

.. Note:: Submitting a paper is **optional**.

The session materials go on the BoostCon CD handed out to attendees.

For general information on the BoostCon 2009 paper submission or the scope 
of technical papers solicited, please refer to the conference website at 
www.boostcon.com. For any other questions about the submission process or 
paper format, please contact the Program Committee at 
boostcon09@easychair.com. If you have any technical problems with 
EasyChair, please contact EasyChair for help.

.. Note:: Presenters must agree to grant a non-exclusive perpetual
   license to publish submitted materials, either electronically or in
   print, in any media related to BoostCon.

Financial Details
-----------------

Like Boost itself, BoostCon is strictly non-profit. Conference
organizers are not paid for their time. Any surplus money will be
rolled over into the succeeding year BoostCon budget. 

BoostCon provides free admission for all 90 minute and longer
session presenters. This year we also hope to have enough revenue
to pay presenters of longer sessions a small honorarium.
