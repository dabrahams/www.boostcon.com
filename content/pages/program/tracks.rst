Tracks
======

Recognizing the breadth of our community, BoostCon is aimed at
everyone from the budding Boost end-user to the most hard-core
Boost library developer.  Originally we were planning to run two
tracks separated along those lines, but after reviewing the best
submissions available, the program committee found that division to
be both strained and artificial.  After all, every Boost developer
is also a Boost end-user.  

Still, Boosters' many interests call for more material than will
fit into a single track, and fortunately we got the high-quality
proposals that will allow us to serve everyone.  In the end, we
ended up with, simply, *Track I* and *Track II*.  Feel free to hop
between them at will; they're merely a scheduling device.
