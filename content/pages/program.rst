In the spirit of Boost, we have tried to encourage sessions that
are participatory and/or collaborative in nature, and set up a
relaxed schedule so that there's plenty of time for interaction.
Sessions will run in the morning and evening, leaving a midday
break of two hours so that attendees can get out and enjoy the town
and its surroundings, or just to have time to work together in
small, informal groups.
