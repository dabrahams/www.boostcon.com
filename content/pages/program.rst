Schedule
--------

BoostCon starts Sunday night with an informal gathering and ends
Friday around midday.  We maintain a relaxed pace so that there's
plenty of time for interaction.  Sessions will run in the morning and
evening, leaving a midday break of two hours so that attendees can get
out and enjoy the town and its surroundings, or just to have time to
work together in small, informal groups.

  Please see a `previous years' schedule`__ for a detailed example.
