Why a Boost Conference?
-----------------------

Since its inception in 1998, Boost_ has been growing steadily in
size, scope, and popularity.  Today, Boost's `75+ libraries`__ are
part of numerous `commercial applications`__, are packaged with
every major Linux distribution, and are used as a `must-pass
testbed`__ for every serious C++ compiler.  By the spring of 2006,
it became apparent that there had been an explosion
of interest.  Among other things:

- Demand for Boost-related training was way up

- We were hearing stories of Boost adoption in the C++ mainstream
  like never before

- Scott Meyers (among others) gave *two* Boost-related presentations
  at SD West

- *All* Boost talks at SD West were heavily attended

- Mailing list traffic had continued to increase,  on both the
  Boost developer's and the Boost user's lists

Still, Boost is still in some ways a well-kept secret.  It sometimes
seems as though most C++ programmers are still working with the
bare-bones facilities of the current C++ standard library
(often with limited power).  

In light of Boost's growing popularity and its potential to reach
many more developers, and with TR1 and becoming more relevant to
all C++ programmers, it was time to kick things into high
gear, and a conference seemed like the perfect vehicle.  We've gone
far with our online process, but there's no substitute for
face-to-face contact when building a strong and vibrant community.

Size
----

Initial conference capacity is less than 100 registrants, so we
recommend securing your place early.  Contingency plans are in
place that may allow expansion if demand runs high, but itâ€™s
important to us that the first few conferences stay small enough to
assure you a quality experience.  Registrants past the initial
quota will be waitlisted.
