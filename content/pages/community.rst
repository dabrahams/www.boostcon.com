Early feedback indicates BoostCon'07 was indeed a smashing success!
Many attendees wanted a way to collaborate, discuss their future
plans, and share pictures from the event.  Of course, it would have
been nice to put together this part of the site *before* the
conference, but at least it will stand us in good stead for
BoostCon'08.  Check out the submenu entries on the left for
community resources.

BoostCon attendees who followed the directions in their
registration invitation for this site can find updated slides `on
the wiki`__.
