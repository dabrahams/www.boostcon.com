Nightlife

As a playground for Hollywood galmourati and home of the winter
X-Games, Aspen has a reputation as a party town.  While things do
cool down a bit in springtime, you'll find Aspen's pubs, clubs, and
microbreweries alive and kickin', without the peak season crowds.

Arts and Entertainment

Aspen is known for its vibrant community of artists and musicians,
nurtured by the town's many public programs (notably the Aspen
Music Festival and Aspen Filmfest) and the inspiring scenery.  A
great place to catch some authentic bluegrass Music.
