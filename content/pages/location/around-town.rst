Nightlife
---------

As a playground for Hollywood galmourati and home of the winter
X-Games, Aspen has a reputation as a party town.  While things do
cool down a bit in springtime, you'll find Aspen's pubs, clubs, and
microbreweries alive and kickin', without the peak season crowds.

Arts and Entertainment
----------------------

Aspen is known for its vibrant community of artists and musicians,
nurtured by the town's many public programs (notably the Aspen
Music Festival and Aspen Filmfest) and the inspiring scenery.  A
great place to catch some authentic bluegrass Music.

Getting Around
--------------

Aspen is a compact town, and the conference venue and hotel are
within walking distance of downtown shops and restaurants.
