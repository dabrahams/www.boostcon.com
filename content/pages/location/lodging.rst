The conference hotel is the `Aspen Meadows resort`__.
This Bauhaus-inspired resort lies on 40 acres overlooking the
Roaring Fork River. Surrounded by bike paths, walking trails, and
mountain views, the resort is home to the Aspen Institute, an
international nonprofit organization 
dedicated to fostering dialogue on global concerns.  Hotel amenities
include a health club that offers a range of workout equipment, a
half-court gym, steam rooms, and an outdoor pool and spa
tub. Complimentary wireless Internet access is provided throughout
the resort.  A business center provides complimentary services such
as computer use, scanning, copying, and printing.

The Aspen Meadows Resort is approximately a block from the Aspen
Center for Physics and ten blocks from `downtown Aspen`__.  Many
visitors find it a very pleasant walk, but the resort also runs a
complimentary shuttle into town daily.
