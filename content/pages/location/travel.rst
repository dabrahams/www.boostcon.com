.. Note:: Unlike last year, the Aspen/Pitkin County airport, Sardy
   Field, will be **open** for direct flights directly into Aspen.
   However, these flights fill up quickly so we recommend you book
   early.

Ground Transportation
=====================

The Aspen Meadows resort runs a free shuttle for its guests to and
from Aspen Airport.  Participants who book flights into either
Denver (DEN) or Eagle (EGE) airports will need to travel about 4
hours by ground.  See below for more details.

Denver or Eagle Airport to Aspen and Return
-------------------------------------------

:Shuttle: `Colorado Mountain Express`__ (CME)
:Reservations: 1-800-525-6363.  (Advance reservations essential.
   Use this number for both Aspen and Eagle reservations) 

__ http://www.cmex.com/

CME runs shuttle bus service from both Denver and Eagle airports to
Aspen.  Each van holds 8-10 people.  **We recommend that you
make reservations with CME directly**, and that you do so **as soon
as you have your flight information.** Identify yourself as a
BoostCon participant.  If there are 6-10 people traveling together
to the Boost conference you may wish to investigate chartering van
service from CME.

Airport pick up and drop off location:

:Denver:		Ground Transportation Center, lower level.

	Scheduled departures at 12 noon and 3 pm.  Flights should
	arrive by 11 am and 2 pm respectively.  If there is sufficient
	demand to warrant adding additional departures, they will be
	happy to add more service.

:Eagle:	Outside main door to terminal.  

   Departures are flight-specific.  Please have your flight
   information complete before you call CME for shuttle
   transportation from the Eagle Airport.

Rates

:From Denver: $101/person, tax included, one way 

:From Eagle: $57/person, tax included, one way	

Driving From Denver
-------------------

Although the drive from Denver to Aspen is 185 miles in summer, it
is 222 miles (and approximately 4 hours) long at the time of our
conference because the shorter route over `Independence Pass`__ is
closed until the snow melts off.  Therefore, when planning your
drive from Denver to Aspen **be sure to follow the** |route|_.
Your destination is Aspen Meadows Resort, 845 Meadows Rd., Aspen CO
81611.

.. Warning:: We advise against trying to avoid Glenwood Springs by
   taking Route 6 from Eagle.  It's a dirt road for part of the
   way, and if there's bad weather, the dirt turns to clay or
   worse.
