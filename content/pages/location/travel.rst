.. Note:: This year the Aspen/Pitkin County airport (ASE), (also
   known as Sardy Field), will be **open** for flights directly
   into Aspen.  However, these flights fill up quickly so we
   recommend you book early.

Flying into Aspen/Pitkin County airport (ASE)
---------------------------------------------

The easiest way to get to Aspen is to book a flight directly into
Aspen/Pitkin County airport.  Aspen is a compact town, and the
Aspen Meadows resort runs a free shuttle for its guests, so if you
fly all the way to Aspen, you shouldn't need a car at all.  You can
fly to Aspen through Salt Lake City on Delta or through Denver on
United.  **Update:** Frontier Airlines is now flying into Aspen as
of April 26th, five times daily with a new 70 passenger Q-400
airplane.

Flying into Denver (DEN) or Eagle (EGE)
---------------------------------------

Some people decide to fly to one of the larger regional airports
and travel about 4 hours on the road.  The scenery in the area is
beautiful, and the drive is very pleasant.  You may find this
alternative to be more economical.

Ground Transportation
=====================

Participants flying into Denver or Eagle Colorado will want to
arrange further transportation in order to reach Aspen.  The most
common options are detailed below.

Denver or Eagle Airport to Aspen and Return
-------------------------------------------

:Shuttle: `Colorado Mountain Express`__ (CME)
:Reservations: 1-800-525-6363.  (Advance reservations essential.
   Use this number for both Aspen and Eagle reservations) 

__ http://www.cmex.com/

CME runs shuttle bus service from both Denver and Eagle airports to
Aspen.  Each van holds 8-10 people.  **We recommend that you
make reservations with CME directly**, and that you do so **as soon
as you have your flight information.** Identify yourself as a
BoostCon participant.  If there are 6-10 people traveling together
to the Boost conference you may wish to investigate chartering van
service from CME.

Airport pick up and drop off location:

:Denver:		Ground Transportation Center, lower level.

	Scheduled departures at 12 noon and 3 pm.  Flights should
	arrive by 11 am and 2 pm respectively.  If there is sufficient
	demand to warrant adding additional departures, they will be
	happy to add more service.
:Eagle:	Outside main door to terminal.  

   Departures are flight-specific.  Please have your flight
   information complete before you call CME for shuttle
   transportation from the Eagle Airport.

Driving From Denver
-------------------

Although the drive from Denver to Aspen is 185 miles in summer, it
is 222 miles (and approximately 4 hours) long at the time of our
conference because the shorter route over `Independence Pass`__ is
closed until the snow melts off.  Therefore, when planning your
drive from Denver to Aspen **be sure to follow the** |route|_.
Your destination is Aspen Meadows Resort, 845 Meadows Rd., Aspen CO
81611.

.. Warning:: We advise against trying to avoid Glenwood Springs by
   taking Route 6 from Eagle.  It's a dirt road for part of the
   way, and if there's bad weather, the dirt turns to clay or
   worse.
