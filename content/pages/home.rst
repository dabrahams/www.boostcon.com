Promising to be **the** main face-to-face event for all things
Boost_, *BoostCon 2010* opens the door to your C++ future.  From using
the Boost libraries to writing and maintaining them, from
evangelizing to deploying Boost within your organization, from
infrastructure and process to vision and mission, and from TR1 to
TR2, BoostCon brings together the sessions, the colleagues, and the
inspiration to support your work with Boost for the next year.

To reflect the breadth of the Boost community, the conference
includes sessions aimed at two constituencies: Boost end-users and
hard-core Boost library and tool developers. The program fosters
interaction and engagement within *and across* those two groups,
with an emphasis on hands-on, participatory sessions.
