Speaker FAQ
===========

:order: 100

Will there be a digital video projector available?
  Yes.

Will there be an audio system available?
  Yes.
  
Will there be a computer available?
  No, please bring your own or arrange with the program committee to
  get access to one.   

Do I have to use PowerPoint?
  No. OpenOffice.org's Impress and Apple's Keynote are popular
  alternatives. 

What are some of the elements of a good presentation?
  Take a look at Doug Gregor's Google Tech Talk presentation at
  http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1790714981047186825 

  Suggestions from experienced presenters include:

  * Think about who your audience is, and target your talk toward
    the middle of that audience. Boost users, for example, are
    C++-literate and can be assumed to know about Boost in general,
    so concentrate on the Boost library you are presenting.

  * Your audience can read, so don't just stand there and read your
    slides to them. Explain the bullet points or code examples on
    your slides. Give the rationale behind the design. Relate new
    material to things they are already familiar with. 

  * Do include code examples; C++ programmers often understand code
    examples better than prose descriptions.

  * Look at your audience. Make eye contact.

  * Repeat questions from the audience before answering, particularly
    with a larger audience where not everyone may be able to hear
    other audience members. 

  * Don't just tell your audience what something is, tell them how to
    use it themselves. Show them real code.

  * Involve your audience; ask them questions.

How many people will attend my session?
  Given the capacity of the rooms, plan on a maximum of 100 and a
  minimum of 20. 

How much time should I reserve for questions?
  This can vary from speaker to speaker and topic to topic, but
  something of the order of 10 minutes for a 90-minute session. You
  can take questions as they arise, leave them until the end (or,
  for long sessions, just before the next break), or a mix of both,
  but be sure to let the audience know at the beginning if you are
  happy to take questions as they come or whether you prefer to
  leave them until the end. Of course, if you are involving the
  audience by asking them questions, you should expect questions in
  return during the session. In taking questions during the
  session, try to be brief and to not get sidetracked. If a
  question deserves a longer answer than the flow of the material
  allows, or is a little off topic, say so and suggest coming back
  to it either at the end or offline. 

How can I tell how long my presentation will take?
  It depends on the amount of detail on each slide, the amount of
  time allowed for questions, any time budgeted for demos, and, of
  course, the typical slide velocity of the presenter. If you are
  unsure, it is worth rehearsing all or part of your presentation
  to get a sense of the timing. Different presenters have different
  average slide velocities: some presenters use only a few slides,
  and move to a new slide once every five minutes or so; others
  move through their slides at a rapid rate, up to once every
  minute or so. Work out where you are on this scale and determine
  a slide limit based on the duration of your session divided by
  your typical slide velocity. 

Can I compile/run stuff, or must everything be on slides?
  Running compiles or demos can add interest, but be very sure the
  app will work! Live demos are notorious failure points. There is
  nothing sadder that attending a presentation designed around a
  live demo that the presenter can't get working. 

What material should I provide for CD that is to be distributed to attendees? 
  At the minimum, provide a PDF file of your slides. The more
  recent versions of presentation software provides the ability to
  output PDF files. If you're on Windows and need some free software
  to work with Office, you can use PDFCreator http://www.pdfforge.org/products/pdfcreator.
  Another option for creating PDFs is <http://createpdf.adobe.com/> -  
  the first 5 are free.

Must I stay in the conference hotel?
  No, although part of the fun and benefits of a conference come
  from offline interactions with attendees in informal settings
  such as the hotel bar :-) 

When should I plan to arrive?
  At a minimum, please plan to arrive the day before your session,
  and allow plenty of leeway for travel delays. And of course we
  hope you will come for the entire conference, and leave some time
  to enjoy the spectacular setting.
