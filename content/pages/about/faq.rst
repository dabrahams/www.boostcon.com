Why Aspen?
  It's an understandable question: when some people think of Aspen,
  they see a glitzy skiing and shopping playground for the rich.
  But this town has another side that's in many ways stronger and
  more fundamental: a tradition of fostering intellectual and
  artistic collaboration.  Every year the `Aspen Institute`_, `Music
  Festival`_, and `Center for Physics`_ draw the most talented people in
  the world to work together.  They come, not just because their
  colleagues are there, but because Aspen has an elusive quality
  that inspires great moments.

Why the long lunch break?
  Think back to the conferences you've been to.  If your experience
  is like ours,
  the parts that really stick with you happen between scheduled
  conference sessions, meeting new people and working with old
  friends.  We wanted to build in time for these serendipitous
  moments that only happen on the side at other conferences.  Also,
  we thought it was important that attendees have an opportunity to
  enjoy the natural surroundings and scenery during the best part
  of the day, rather than being stuck inside a darkend room with an
  LCD projector.

.. _small block:

Why is the reserved room block at Aspen Meadows so small?  
  In order to reserve any rooms, we had to agree to cover the entire
  cost of any reserved rooms we were unable to fill.  Boost simply
  doesn't have enough money “in the bank” to guarantee any more rooms
  than we have, and we were unable to find anyone who was willing to
  assume liability for more rooms.  As we collect registration fees we
  may be able to negotiate for an enlarged reserved room block.  As
  there is not a large guaranteed rooms block, BoostCon participants
  need to make their reservations early to ensure a room at the
  convenient host hotel.

Other conferences I've been to were much bigger.  Why is this one so small__?
  It all comes down to budget and atmosphere.  In BoostCon's first
  years, it is especially important to minimize the risk of
  failure, and as a non-profit conference without big corporate
  backers, that means keeping a tight rein on expenses.  The `Aspen
  Center for Physics`__ was made available to us as a conference
  facility at an exceptionally attractive rate.  While its size is
  limited, that is also part of its charm.  The Physics
  Center is one of the most beautiful and inspiring places to be in
  Aspen.  Success for BoostCon also means that attendees have an
  exceptional experience; one that's different from what you expect
  from most software development events.  We believe that keeping
  it small, and holding it at the Physics Center, will allow us to
  provide that uniqueness.

Why a Boost Conference now?
  In light of Boost's growing popularity and its potential to reach
  many more developers, and with TR1 and becoming more relevant to
  all C++ programmers, it was time to kick things into high
  gear, and a conference seemed like the perfect vehicle.  |more|__

Who profits from my registration fee?
  BoostCon is a strictly *non-profit* conference.  Your
  registration fee is used to pay for the use of facilities, A/V
  equipment, and an onsite conference administrator (handling
  registration, making sure there's plenty of coffee, etc.)  
  If there is any money left over when the conference is over, it
  will be rolled into a fund to pay for next year's conference.
