Shops
=====

Zoltan “cad” Juhasz, the volunteer designer of the Boost and
BoostCon logos, has set up two webshops offering stylish and
well-made BoostCon logo merchandise.  After covering the
substantial cost of establishing the shops himself, Zoltan has
graciously agreed to share half of any profits with the fund for
future editions of BoostCon.

U.S. residents can use the `USA shop`__; all others should use the `EU
shop`__.
