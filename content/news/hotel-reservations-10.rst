In past years, when we didn't book rooms early enough they were
snapped up by other visitors to Aspen, which meant that a substantial
number of participants had to stay off-site and take a shuttle to get
to the conference.  Especially in such a small conference, the
community experience is always much stronger if everyone can stay
together and walk to the conference rooms, and the other options tend
to be *much* further from the conference site.  Head on over to the
`hotel reservations page`__ and make your reservation now.
