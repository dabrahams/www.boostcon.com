:Summary: 2010 Keynote: Maurice Herlihy, *Transactional Memory Today*

In the race to find a parallel programming model that is both scalable
to many cores and comprehensible to many mortals, “Transactional
Memory” is a leading contender.  Moreover, it can be done in software,
which means there are library-based approaches!  Thus, at BoostCon
this year we have a strong track focusing on this technological
frontier, and as a foundation, our keynote speaker is one of the
pioneers.  Maurice Herlihy, winner of the 2003 Dijkstra Prize in
Distributed Computing and co-winner of the 2004 Goedel Prize, coined
the term "Transactional Memory" in a 1993 paper that won the ISCA
Influential Paper award in 2008.  This is not one you'll want to miss!
