Hotel Now Accepting Reservations
================================

:Date: 2009-1-1

:Summary: The Aspen Meadows is `now accepting room reservations`__ for
  BoostCon'09.  Register early and ensure you'll stay at the
  conference site!

Last year, a substantial number of participants had to stay off-site
and take a shuttle to get to the conference and associated events.
Especially in such a small conference, the community experience is
always much stronger if everyone can stay together, and the other
options tend to be *much* further from the conference site.  Head on
over to our `hotel reservations page`__ and make your reservation now.

.. Admonition:: Why You Really Need to Book **Now** 

   When reserving a room block at a hotel one must agree in advance to
   pay for any reserved room-nights that aren't eventually taken by
   your group.  That's known as an attrition charge, and it's a
   standard practice.  Because of BoostCon's limited capital
   resources—we don't have a fund that would allow us to cover a large
   room block if something catastrophic happened and the conference
   was cancelled—we have never been able to reserve more than a
   handful of rooms.

   As a result, other groups who want to reserve a room block and can
   guarantee payment of the attrition charge will be able to reserve
   rooms and prevent you from getting a reservation.  Every year so
   far, such a group has come along before all Boosters got rooms.  We
   intend to build up a capital fund so that won't be a problem in the
   future, but for now, your best defense against having to stay
   off-site is to reserve your room early.
