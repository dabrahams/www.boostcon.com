Keynote '09: Andrei Alexandrescu
================================

:Date: 2008-12-23

:Summary: We're very lucky to have Andrei Alexandrescu as our keynote
          speaker this year!

We don't know what he'll be speaking about yet (expect to find out by
the end of January), but from past experience with his talks, we know
it will be hard-core but approachable, fascinating *and* especially
entertaining.  See `Andrei's Homepage`__ for more information about
him and his work.
