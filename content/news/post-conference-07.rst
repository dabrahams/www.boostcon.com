BoostCon'07 a Smash Hit
=======================

:Date: 2007-05-24

:Summary: BoostCon'07 closed last week to unanimous rave reviews
  from participants.  “One of the best events I've been to in a
  long time,” wrote Scott Meyers.

Scott does a *lot* of conferences, so he should know.  Similar
feedback was received repeatedly, during and after the conference,
by presenters and attendees alike.  Thanks to all who attended for
making the inaugural BoostCon such a great experience.
