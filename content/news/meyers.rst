Scott Meyers Presents Intro to TR1 and Boost
============================================

:Date: 2007-01-01
:Summary: Scott Meyers will be presenting his 
  “\ `Shotgun Firehose Introduction to TR1 and Boost`__\ ” at BoostCon this year.

If there's one thing Scott is known for, it's his impact on the
daily practice of mainstream C++ programmers.  His “\ `Effective
C++`__\ ”
series has become a fundamental building block of the C++ lexicon,
and is the foundation on which thousands of programmers base their
understanding of quality software.  It's exciting to see Boost
entering the training repertoire of such an influential author and
especially so because he is such a phenomenal presenter in person.
We're very lucky to have him on the program.
