=========================

:Summary: Couldn't make it to BoostCon this year?  Here’s the next
   best thing—a lively `trip report`__ from one of its presenters.

Eric Niebler has written an article at `The C++ Source`__ that
will not only tell you what happened, but give you a great sense of
the flavor of the event.  See
