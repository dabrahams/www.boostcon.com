==============================

:Date: 2007-02-18

:Summary: Sean Parent, engineering manager of the Adobe Software
  Technology Lab, will be giving our keynote address this year.

His talk, “\ `A Possible Future for Software Development`__,” challenges
the conventional wisdom about the OO paradigm and advances a
viewpoint in which the design principles of Generic Programming (as
expressed in the standard library and supported by Boost) offer a
way toward quality, scalable, software.
