Sphene Community Tools are django applications designed to be easily
pluggable into any django project.


## Directories

- sphenecoll/	Collection of django application (the base source for SCT).
- static/	Static media files which contain images and css.

## Requirements

- [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com) - I'm using the latest version from 
  the subversion trunk.
- Python >= 2.4
- [PyCrypto](http://sf.net/projects/pycrypto) - (e.g. debian package python-crypto)

## Installation

### Apply Patches

As of 2007-05-13 no patches are needed any more. The customization of
the permalink function is now included in sphene.community.sphutils.

- permalink_with_additional_function_arg.diff - see <http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/3530>


### Python library path

You need to add libs/ and sphenecoll/ to your python include path and
static/ needs to be served from your django installation.
(static/sphene/ is enough)


## Examples

The examples/ directory (currently) contains one example project.
Please see the README file in it's directory (examples/simpleproject)
for more information.
