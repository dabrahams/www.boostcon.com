Dear {{firstname}}, 

It was great to be with you at BoostCon'07.  

We thought you should know we've just launched a community portal
with:

* a Wiki where you can collaborate with other attendees
  (http://boostcon.com/community/wiki)

* a private Wiki area where you can download updated slide sets,
  and you can post anything that you only want seen by other
  BoostCon'07 attendees.
  (http://boostcon.com/community/wiki/show/private/2007/)

* a Photo gallery where you can view and upload portrait and snapshots
  from the event (http://boostcon.com/community/photos).

* a set of discussion forums (http://boostcon.com/community/forums)
  

To continue registration visit the following link:

Thanks again for your role in the Boost community, and for making
BoostCon'07 such a success,

  The BoostCon Organizers

P.S. See you next May at BoostCon '08!
